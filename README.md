# Next.js Basic Login and Registration Authentication

This project is a simple, secure authentication and authorization system built using **Next.js**. It includes essential user management features such as registration, login, and protected routes. It provides a great starting point for developers looking to integrate authentication into their Next.js applications.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can create accounts with unique credentials.
- **Login System**: Authenticated users can log in using their registered credentials.
- **JWT Authentication**: Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication, enabling session management without server-side state.
- **Protected Routes**: Ensures that certain pages or resources are only accessible to authenticated users.
- **User Authorization**: Implements role-based authorization, allowing access control based on user roles.
- **Password Hashing**: Ensures user passwords are securely stored using hashing techniques.

## How It Works

- **Next.js API Routes**: Handles user authentication and registration via Next.js API routes (`/login`, `/register`). These routes interact with the database to create users and verify login credentials.
  
- **JWT Tokens**: When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT token. This token is sent back to the client and stored, typically in cookies or local storage. For each subsequent request, the client sends the token to authenticate and gain access to protected routes.

- **Protected Pages**: Certain pages are restricted to logged-in users. The token is checked on the server-side, and if the user is authenticated, they can access the content. If not, they are redirected to the login page.
